## Algorithms on Graphs Programming Assignment 03: Paths in Graphs 1
### Problems
Practice implementing algorithms for finding shortest paths in graphs:
* [`/src/bfs/BFS.java`](src/bfs/BFS.java): Problem 1, Computing the Minimum Number of Flight Segments, computes the minimum number of flight segments to get from one city to another one;
* [`/src/bipartite/Bipartite.java`](src/bipartite/Bipartite.java): Problem 2, Checking whether a Graph is Bipartite, checks whether a graph is bipartite.
